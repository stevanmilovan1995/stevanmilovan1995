# 👋 Hi there! I’m Stevan Milovanovic!  

🐛 **Bug Detective | QA Engineer | Automation Dabbler**  
I help make software a little less buggy and a lot more reliable. With experience in **PLM** and **betting**, I’ve broken (and fixed) more apps than I can count. Whether it’s manual testing or automation, I’m all about finding sneaky issues and making life easier for users.  

## 💡 What I’m good at (most of the time):  
- Writing automation scripts that actually work (Java, C#, Selenium).  
- Poking APIs with Postman until they spill their secrets.  
- Running JMeter tests to see how much a system can take before it cries.  
- Asking way too many “what if” questions during exploratory testing.  

## 🔧 My toolbox:  
Java | C# | Selenium | Postman | JMeter | Swagger | Kafka | MSSQL | Oracle | Git  

## 🤔 Fun-ish facts about me:  
- Once automated 80% of a project’s tests, which was a great excuse to grab more coffee during regression runs.  
- I believe no bug is too small to ruin someone’s day (or my sanity).  

📫 **Let’s chat!**  
Whether you want to talk QA, share testing memes, or collaborate on a project, I’m just a click away. Let’s make software better (and maybe have some fun along the way)!
